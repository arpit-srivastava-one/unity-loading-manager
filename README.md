# Loading Manager
Loading Manager can be used to load between different scenes, using a loading menu overlayed at top of the screen. This is a **resusable asset** I use for my projects. It can perform the following functionalities -

- Loads between different scenes.
- Stays persisent between scenes.
- Able to customize the Loading Menu.

### How to use it?
- Drag and drop ```LoadingManager.prefab``` into your scene.
- Call the function of ```LoadScene(string sceneName)``` of ```LoadingManager``` class.
- Check ```SceneA``` and ```SceneB``` for testing out LoadingManager in action.
